# AllMediaDesk-Application
Software Developer Intern test

The test tasks were made using C++ in Eclipse IDE. The folders include .exe files, which will be used to run the individual programs.

Test 1 uses Reverse Polish Notation and the Shunting Yard algorithm to complete calculations input by the user.

Test 2 uses a recursive for loop to take the user input number and output the closest tidy number(digits arranged in non-decreasing order) to that input.

Test 3 proved to be a roadbloack due the call to graph an equation input by the user. C++ does not inherently have any graphical or plotting libraries that would assist in this task. Upon encountering this issue I found that C++ can make calls to MatLab functions to produce a graph, but I did not have enough experience using the MatLab platform to execute this change in the alloted time. In the future I would like to impliment the Matlab calls to my C++ program in order to produce graphs of equations.

Thank you for your time.
